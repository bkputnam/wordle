# Wordle solver

My attempts at programmatically generating good wordle guesses. To run:

```
npm install
npm run main
```

## Useful commands

See `package.json` for `npm run $SCRIPT` commands.

```
// Builds and copys built files to brian-putnam.com, which is assumed to
// be checked out to a sibling directory
./copyToWebsite.sh
```
