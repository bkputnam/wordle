# Wordle solver

My attempts at programmatically generating good wordle guesses. To run:

1. Install NodeJS. Recommended route (even though this repo doesn't
   need a specific version of node):

    1. [Install `nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
    2. `nvm install node`

2. Install package deps:

```
npm install
```

3. Run `main`:

```
npm run main
```

## Useful commands

See `package.json` for `npm run $SCRIPT` commands.

```
// Builds and copys built files to brian-putnam.com, which is assumed to
// be checked out to a sibling directory
./copyToWebsite.sh
```
